Demo Plugin for IntelliJ-based IDE
This is a basic plugin for an IntelliJ-based IDE that adds an additional button (action) to the UI. When the user clicks on the button, a modal window is opened with a choice of two buttons. Each of these buttons opens a URL of your choice in the internal browser (web view).

Usage
To use this plugin, follow these steps:

Run the configuration called "run plugin".
Navigate to Tools > Internal actions > UI > Demos > KRATOS.
Click on the button to open the modal window.
Choose one of the options and click on the corresponding button to open the URL in the internal browser (web view).
Have fun!
