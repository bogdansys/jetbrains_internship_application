# Demo Plugin for IntelliJ-based IDE
This is a basic plugin for an IntelliJ-based IDE that adds an additional button (action) to the UI. When the user clicks on the button, a modal window is opened with a choice of two buttons. Each of these buttons opens a URL of your choice in the internal browser (web view).
